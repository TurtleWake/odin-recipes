<h2>How to Make Chewy Gluten-Free Soft Pretzels</h2>
<p>Soft pretzels are just about perfect. They’re chewy, 
salty and great with everything from a beer to a salad. The thing is: 
they’re chewy. And gluten-free flour doesn’t do chewy well.</p>

<h3>Ingrediants</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups finely ground white rice flour</li>
    <li>1 cup brown rice flour</li>
    <li>3/4 cup tapioca starch</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon xanthan gum</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1 cup warm water plus 2 tablespoons </li>
    <li>1 packet active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons light corn syrup</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
</ul>
<h4>Water Bath</h4>
<ul>
    <li>16 cups water</li>
    <li>1/4 cup baking soda</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
</ul>
<h4>Toppings</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Kosher Salt</li>
    <li>(Optional)Cheese</li>
    <li>(Optional)Pepperoni</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps For Making</h3>
<ol>
    <li>For the Pretzels: In the bowl of stand mixer, combine white 
        rice flour, brown rice flour, tapioca starch, salt, xanthan gum,
        and baking powder. Whisk to combine.</li>
    <li>In a small bowl, combine 1 cup warm water and active dry yeast.
        Stir with a fork. Allow to stand for three minutes. Add 
        water-yeast mixture, egg, light corn syrup, and vegetable
        oil to dry ingredients.</li>
    <li>Fit stand mixer with paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed 
        until dough forms, about 4 minutes. The dough should be firm
        but not dry. If any dry ingredients remain at the bottom of 
        the bowl or if the dough seems dry, add the additional 2 
        tablespoons water.</li>
    <li>Turn dough out onto lightly white rice-floured counter. 
        Dust your hands with white rice flour and knead dough into a 
        ball until smooth. Take care not to use too much pressure while 
        kneading.</li>
    <li>Transfer dough to lightly greased bowl. Lightly brush the dough 
        with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow to rise 
        until almost doubled in size, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
    <li>Adjust oven racks to middle position and preheat oven to 425°F. 
        Bring 4 quarts of water to a rolling boiling. Turn dough out onto 
        a very lightly white rice floured countertop. Punch down dough 
        gently to deflate. Cut into 12 pieces. Cover dough with plastic 
        wrap. One at a time, knead each piece of dough until smooth. Then, 
        roll out the dough pieces into 12 to14-inch logs. (You want little 
        to no white rice flour on the area of the counter where you are 
        rolling the dough. If there is too much flour on the outside of 
        the dough, the pretzel dough won't stick to itself when you go to 
        shape it.)</li>
    <li>Line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Working one 
        log at a time, form the dough into a into "u". Twist each end 
        together and then press the rope into the bottom of the "u". 
        You want to press the dough firmly to ensure the ends stick to 
        the "u" or the pretzel can unravel during boiling. Place shaped 
        pretzels on prepared baking sheet.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Water Bath:</strong>Add the baking soda and granulated 
        sugar to the boiling water. One at a time, boil the pretzels. 
        If the pretzel floats, boil for about five seconds. If the 
        pretzel sinks, wait for it to float to the top of the water and 
        then remove. Return boiled pretzels to the prepared baking 
        sheets. Sprinkle generously with kosher or pretzel salt.</li>
